                    As a student in college I basically stumbled upon a love for programming and user experience. I always knew I wanted a career that was rewarding and made a difference in people's lives but didnâ€™t necessarily know how I would do that. As I studied I realized there was so much room for improvement in how we experience technology as a whole. For the first time I knew exactly how I could help the world!

                    Working in the digital world I find myself in front a computer quite a bit. After work I like to get outside and away from technology for a little while. My beautiful wife and I like to take our two Australian Shepherds to the dog park or on walks to get away for a short mental vacation. We are lucky to live in a place with so much natural beauty around us.
